# Earthquake-Damage-Prediction

Here we have tried to predict Earthquake Damage for the real time data of 2015 Nepal Earthquake 

Dependent variable `damage grade` is an ordinal variable consisting of values one among the set {1,2,3} and hence we have used Classification Models.

Jupyter File consists of

- [x] Data PreProcessing
- [x] Data Visualisation
- [x] Hypotheses Testing
- [x] Feature Elimination
- [x] Different ML Models like Random Forest Classifier,XGBoost Classifier,Decision Tree Classifier etc
